# Scheduler
## Node.js scheduler library using Redis

Wite a simple application server that prints a message at a given time in the future.

The server has only 1 API:

- ```echoAtTime``` - which receives two parameters, time and message, and writes that message to the server console at the given time.

Since we want the server to be able to withstand restarts it will use [redis](https://redis.io) to persist the messages and the time they should be sent at. You should also **assume that there might be more than one server running behind a load balancer* (load balancing implementation itself does not need to be provided as part of the answer)

In case the server was down when a message should have been printed, it should print it out when going back online.
